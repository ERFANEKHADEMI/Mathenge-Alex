### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex Maina, a Full-Stack Software Developer. Programming is my carer and hobby. I am excited when I make mental conceptions work in real life by coding them into useful systems and features.
If you would ask me, I'd tell you that I love what I do and I'm ready to do it even better today.
                        Cheers!
